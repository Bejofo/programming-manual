# Nerd stuff
The syntax of Lisp is heavily inspired by lambda calculus. It is noticebly different from other
programming languages and sometimes jokingly called parentheses hell.

An important concept of Lisp is the S-expression. All programs, datastrutres are writted as S-expressions.

Unlike other language all operators in Lisp use postfix notations (also sometimes called polish notation).
For example `1+2` would be written as `(+ 1 2 )`
