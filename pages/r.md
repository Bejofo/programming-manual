# R ([r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/))
R is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics creation. Appearing in the early 90s, R was created by two statisticians, Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman. It is very popular for data analysis and statistical software development, notably for its ability to create professional-grade graphics from data.

# Nerd Stuff
R is an interpreted language, meaning code may be run through the project's command-line interpreter.

It has qualities from procedural and object-oriented programming, supporting functions and generics (to some extent).

Advanced packages provide users the ability to also execute code of other languages within R.

# Ecosystem
R can be installed from the [project's website](https://www.r-project.org/). There are also popular integrated development environments (IDEs) such as [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/categories/rstudio-ide/). In fact, the R website is an extremely useful tool when looking for downloads, help, and more.

The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a popular collection of R packages for data science. It is popular in this field due to shared design philosophy among the packages.

R is a highly extensible language, and as a result, there are many packages out there that greatly expand the language's possibilities.
It can be carefully crafted to serve a specific group's needs.

# Examples
Creating a "Hello World!" program with R is extremely simple:
```
print("Hello World!")
```

# Stats
R has grown over the years, especially as data science has become more popular. According to the [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index), R is now one of the most popular programming languages (Sourced From: https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/r/).
