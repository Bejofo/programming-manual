# JavaScript
JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in just ten days in May 1995, while he was working for Netscape Communications Corporation. Initially, it was called Mocha, then it was renamed to LiveScript and finally, it was renamed to JavaScript(it has nothing to do with Java). It was first introduced as a way to make web pages more interactive and responsive by allowing developers to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the content of a web page.

# Nerd stuff
JavaScript is a popular programming language that is primarily used for developing web applications. It is a high-level, object-oriented, and dynamically typed language that is designed to run in web browsers, allowing developers to create interactive and dynamic web pages.

JavaScript has a vast array of frameworks and libraries that have been developed to make it easier to work with. 

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables are not assigned a specific data type at declaration. This can lead to unexpected bugs and make it more difficult to maintain large codebases.

# Ecosystem
JavaScript does not need a compiler. To get started, simply create a JavaScript file(.js). To run it on the browser, reference the JavaScript file with a srcipt tag in your HTML file.
```
<srcipt src="app.js"></script>
```


# Examples
To print hello world on your browser

In your JavaScript file app.js,
```
console.log('Hello, World!')
```
In your index.html,
```
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <srcipt src="app.js"></script>
  </body>
<html>
```

# Stats
The latest survey in 2022 states that JavaScript is the most used programming language, with a 78% usage rate among developers.
